Do

make 

As a test to make sure it works do

./job_walls

It should output a fort17 and a fort2 file.  You will use the fort17 to plot.  Don't worry if you get -inf in the fort17 file, just replace it with -99 when plotting.
You can change DIREC and WLFILE so this script can run in any directory.  Make sure WLFILE is set to the wavelength file you use for the outer disk.
